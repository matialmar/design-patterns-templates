## Introduction

Design patterns are essential tools for software developers to write robust and maintainable code. This repository provides templates and examples for implementing different design patterns in various programming languages. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about design patterns or an experienced developer seeking a reference, this repository can help you understand and implement these patterns effectively.

## Design Patterns

The repository includes templates for the following design patterns:

**Please Note:** We will be continually adding design patterns to this repository as we write them. If you don't find a specific design pattern you're looking for, check back later, or consider contributing one yourself (see [Contributing](#contributing)).

- [ ] Singleton
- [ ] Factory Method
- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns**
- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator

## Languages

We provide templates and examples for a variety of programming languages, including but not limited to:

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript

We encourage contributions for additional languages and improvements to existing templates.

## How to Use

Each design pattern has its own directory within this repository, organized by language. To use a template:

1. Navigate to the desired design pattern directory and choose the language you prefer.

2. Inside the language directory, you'll find a template or example code that demonstrates the design pattern.

3. Follow the comments and code structure to implement the design pattern in your project.

4. Feel free to adapt and modify the template to suit your specific use case.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new design pattern template or an improvement to an existing one, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.

2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name: `git checkout -b feature/new-pattern` or `git checkout -b improvement/existing-pattern`.

3. Make your changes, add new templates, or improve existing ones.

4. Ensure that your code adheres to the coding standards and includes appropriate comments.

5. Test your template to ensure it works as expected.

6. Create a pull request (PR) with a clear title and description, explaining your changes.

7. Our team will review your PR, provide feedback if needed, and merge it once it's ready.
